# Hello!*
My name is Dhanish Ali aka Danu. I'm 19 years old, from Chennai, India. I'm a Graphic Designer, I do minimal designs and Digital Marketing SEO. I also love to interact with people online, for advice, regular conversations, inspiration, or even opportunities to collaborate. The future of my career will hopefully be to work independently from a group to make fully functioning Branding for large businesses and industry leaders!
